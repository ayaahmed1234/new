    <h3>Exercise 1: "About Me" Page</h3>
    <p>
      Create a page named <code>aboutme.html</code> that describes you. (You can
      use DreamWeaver or Notepad++). On your page, include some or all of the
      following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>your name</li>
      <li>
        A description of yourself in two sentences or less. Emphasize the most
        important word(s) by putting them in bold.
      </li>
      <li>A list of classes you are taking right now at Temple.</li>
      <li>
        At least one link to an interesting site about a TV show/movie/book,
        such as its <a href="">IMDB</a> page
      </li>
      <li>
        Two images, one that represents you when you're happy and the other to
        represent you when you're sad.<br />
        (You can try to search for images on
        <a href="">Google Image Search)</a> .
      </li>
      <li>
        Something interesting about one or more of your neighbors (people
        sitting at computers next to you).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      (You may be tempted to spend all 50 of your minutes on this part of the
      lab. But try to keep the page somewhat short so that you can attempt some
      of the other exercises.)
    </p>
    <p>
      To test your page in the web browser (in Firefox, click File, Open File...
      and browse to your page file to open it).
    </p>
    <p>
      Write your page using valid XHTML 1.1. Include a link from your page to
      the W3C XHTML Validator, using the following image and linking to the
      following site:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="">image: http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml11</a></li>
      <li><a href="">site: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      the next task will be to write a stylesheet for your page, so also include
      a link to the W3C CSS Validator, using the following image and linking to
      the following site:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="">image: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="">site: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check?uri=</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For example, the following About Me page describes textbook coauthor,
      Victoria Kirst (between, but not including, the thick black lines):
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
